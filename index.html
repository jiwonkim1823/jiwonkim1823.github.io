                            Hello! I am Jiwon Kim, a master's student in accounting at Seoul National University. <br>
                            I'm interested in managers' strategic use of voluntary disclosure and the impact of corporate disclosure on a broad set of stakeholders, particularly employees. My recent work focuses on how employees consume corporate disclosure for their decision-making. In a current project, I am studying how firms conduct opportunistic reporting in sustainability reports, focusing on how to measure greenwashing in these reports.

                        <!-- Bolded Description label and collapsible content -->
                        <p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description:</strong> My study reveals that employees use sustainability reports to update and share their perceptions of firms and may detect opportunism in these reports. Existing research offers mixed evidence on whether these reports provide useful information or act as opportunistic narratives due to their voluntary and unregulated nature. My findings suggest that employees' perspectives can provide valuable insights into this debate. This paper is my master's thesis at Seoul National University.</p>

                                    This study reveals that employees utilize sustainability reports to update their perceptions of firms and significantly detect signs of opportunism. First, I find that the publication of these reports triggers a substantial rise in employee reviews, a response more pronounced than that after earnings announcements. Employees’ responses are more robust when the reports are highly readable and address employee-related topics. Furthermore, I find that employees’ job ratings around the time of sustainability report releases are negatively associated with firms’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) ratings, implying a discrepancy between employees’ insider views on sustainability reports and external CSR ratings. This observation implies that employees of high-CSR-rated firms may regard sustainability reports with skepticism, perceiving them as exaggerated narratives and detecting opportunism that is difficult for CSR rating agencies to identify. Employees’ negative reactions to reports characterized by an overly optimistic tone reinforce their capacity to detect opportunism. An analysis of stock market reactions demonstrates alignment with CSR ratings, although only partial alignment with employees’ perceptions, highlighting a gap in the integration of internal perspectives when interpreting sustainability reports. Overall, this study reveals that employees are relevant users of firms’ sustainability reports, and their private knowledge can be useful for interpreting this disclosure.

Our findings indicate that while some firms provide basic descriptions of sustainability goals, others increasingly detail joint projects with supply chains for sustainable practices. We aim to understand how these disclosures impact firms' decisions and performance.
