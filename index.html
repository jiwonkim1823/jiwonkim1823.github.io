                            Hello! I am Jiwon Kim, a master's student in accounting at Seoul National University. <br>
                            I'm interested in managers' strategic use of voluntary disclosure and the impact of corporate disclosure on a broad set of stakeholders, including employees. My recent work focuses on how employees consume corporate disclosure for their decision-making. In a current project, I am studying how firms conduct opportunistic reporting in sustainability reports, focusing on how to measure greenwashing in these reports.

                                Description: My study reveals that employees use sustainability reports to update and share perceptions of firms and detect opportunism. I first document that report releases trigger a significant increase in employee reviews, more pronounced than reactions to earnings announcements, indicating that employees consider firms' social impacts alongside financial aspects. This response is stronger when reports are readable and employee-focused, indicating employees closely engage with the content. I then find that employees’ perceptions are influenced by firms’ CSR ratings and the textual descriptions of these reports. Job ratings are negatively correlated with CSR scores during report release periods. Employees at high CSR-rated firms may detect discrepancies between actual practices and disclosed information, while those at lower-rated firms see future CSR visions. Relying on the notion that CSR rating agencies mainly refer to firms’ sustainability reports, my findings indicate employees are skeptical of managers’ desire to maintain high CSR ratings through exaggerated achievements. Employees’ negative reactions to overly positive tone of these reports support this. Additional analysis of market reactions to sustainability report announcements reveals that investors often rely on CSR ratings to interpret these reports, and investors' views are only partially aligned with employees' views. This indicates a gap in incorporating internal views when interpreting sustainability reports. Collectively, my study reveals that employees are relevant users of firms’ sustainability reports, and their private knowledge might be valuable in detecting opportunism.
