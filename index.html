                            Hello! I am Jiwon Kim, a master's student in accounting at Seoul National University. <br>
                            I'm interested in managers' strategic use of voluntary disclosure and the impact of corporate disclosure on a broad set of stakeholders, particularly employees. My recent work focuses on how employees consume corporate disclosure for their decision-making. In a current project, I am studying how firms conduct opportunistic reporting in sustainability reports, focusing on how to measure greenwashing in these reports.

                        <!-- Bolded Description label and collapsible content -->
                        <p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description:</strong> My study reveals that employees use sustainability reports to update and share their perceptions of firms and may detect opportunism in these reports. Existing research offers mixed evidence on whether these reports provide useful information or act as opportunistic narratives due to their voluntary and unregulated nature. My findings suggest that employees' perspectives can provide valuable insights into this debate. This paper is my master's thesis at Seoul National University.</p>

                                    This study examines whether firms’ sustainability reports cause their employees to reevaluate their companies. By analyzing Glassdoor reviews of U.S. companies, I find that employees actively use sustainability reports to assess their firms, as evidenced by a significant increase in the number of job reviews following the release of these reports. This effect is more pronounced than after earnings announcements. Employees’ responses are especially significant when reports are highly readable and employee-related topics are categorized as one of five major topics by machine learning. I also find that sustainability reports from firms with higher Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) ratings are more likely to elicit negative employee reactions, expressed in job review ratings and tone. This suggests that employees of high-CSR-rated firms perceive these reports as exaggerated narratives or greenwashing, prompting them to express dissent publicly. Employees’ negative reactions to reports with an overly optimistic tone further reinforce their ability to recognize the opportunistic intent behind positively skewed information in these reports. Additional analysis shows that stock market reactions to the publication of sustainability reports are consistent with firms’ CSR ratings but only partially reflect employees’ views, highlighting a gap in incorporating internal perspectives when assessing these reports. Overall, this study implies that employees are significant users of sustainability reports, leveraging their insider knowledge to interpret these disclosures.

                        <!-- Bolded Description label and collapsible content -->
                        <p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description:</strong> As a research project with the POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology) Institute for Sustainability Research, we are investigating how major Korean firms strategically design their sustainability reports, with a particular focus on the extent of disclosure regarding supply chain management. Our initial findings suggest that while some firms provide only basic descriptions of their sustainability goals, others increasingly include detailed accounts of supply chain management practices, such as joint projects with supply chain partners to promote sustainable practices. By applying textual analysis, we aim to quantify the extent of supply chain-related disclosures and assess their impact on firms’ CSR performance.
